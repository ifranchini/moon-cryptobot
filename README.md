# moon-cryptobot

This is my first attempt to create a trading bot. The initial idea is to go through the following steps:

## Binance integration

* Connect to websocket (TBD the preferred way to integrate this)
* Use dana analysis tools to visualize data (I might use TradingView API for this)
* UI for indicators

## Binance - Technical Analysis with python and TALib
